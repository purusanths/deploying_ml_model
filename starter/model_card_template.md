# Model Card

## Model Details
* Developed by Purusanth as a project for Machine learning Nano degree course by Udacity
* Random forest 

## Intended Use
* Interned to be used to lean about MLOps.
* Particularly intented to used by Engineers or Students with intermedite knowlwdge about machine learning

## Training Data
* Census income dataset train and test split

## Evaluation Data
* Census income dataset train and test split
* chose as a basic proof-of-concepts

## Metrics
_Please include the metrics used and your model's performance on those metrics._

## Ethical Considerations
* No PII informations are infereded

## Caveats and Recommendations
* I highly recomend it to lean the MLOps concepts
